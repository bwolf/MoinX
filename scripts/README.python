This directory contains replicated directory structures for certain
packages (e.g. MoinMoin) to allow easier extension (e.g. putting
additional files like plugins or macros) into the Python load path.
Keep in mind, that required 3rd party packages are load from a zip file
to reduce the required disk space.
