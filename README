MoinX is a Mac OS X desktop Wiki, built with ease of use in mind and rich with features. MoinX gives you a full blown and unmodified MoinMoin wiki without forcing you to run a full blown web server. Instead MoinX is bundled with the high performance Twisted web server.
To summarise: MoinX is ideal for keeping notes and howtos, organising links and much more. Whenever I was looking into something new and it took me some time to figure out how it works, I wrote some short notes about it. Of course I do this with MoinX.
